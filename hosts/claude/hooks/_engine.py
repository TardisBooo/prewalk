"""Resolve the vendored ``prewalk_engine`` package for this install layout.

Every Claude Code hook and helper imports this module *before* importing the
engine. Why the indirection: the plugin marketplace installs only the plugin
subtree (``hosts/claude/``), so each host carries its own byte-identical copy
of the package under ``hooks/prewalk_engine/`` — and loose installs, dev
checkouts, and plugin sandboxes each put that directory somewhere slightly
different.

Resolution order:

1. ``$PREWALK_ENGINE`` — a directory containing ``prewalk_engine/`` (tests
   and unusual layouts);
2. this script's own directory — the normal vendored case, because the
   package sits next to the hooks;
3. a short upward walk, for checkouts that run hooks from the repo root.

Usage at the top of a script, before importing the engine::

    import _engine  # noqa: F401  (locates the package; no symbol needed)
    import prewalk_engine as core
