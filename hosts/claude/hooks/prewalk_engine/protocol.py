"""Frozen protocol layer: names, limits, and todo-list rules.

Everything in this module is part of the *contract* between the planner, the
executor, the host adapters, and the on-disk state file:

* phase names are persisted verbatim inside ``prewalk-state.json``;
* packet headings are matched inside assistant messages;
* todo-list rules decide whether a Stop checkpoint is accepted;
* retry limits decide when the adapters stop blocking and start trusting the
  human.

Change any string here and old state files or in-flight sessions will
misinterpret each other — treat additions as the only safe evolution.

The module deliberately has no dependencies outside the standard library (and
no imports from sibling modules), so every other layer can sit on top of it.
